## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r setup}

# Create edx set, validation set

## Load saved image with data


```{r plan, echo=FALSE}

file<- "input_data.rda"
load(file)

#Review previous course to see how to gradually build the recommendation system. go straight to final (start from the back). 


```

## Exploratory analysis on dataset

```{r plan, echo=FALSE}

class(edx)

#Q1: How many rows and columns are there in the edx dataset?
dim(edx)

#Q2: How many zeros were given as ratings in the edx dataset?
 How many threes were given as ratings in the edx dataset?
table(edx$rating) #Table shows no zer-ratings.
sum(edx$rating==0) #To confirm no zero-ratings
sum(edx$rating==3) #To confirm no zero-ratings

#Q3: How many different movies are in the edx dataset?
edx %>% select("title") %>% unique() %>% nrow() #Looking at both MovieId and title to confirm that count is the same
edx %>% select("movieId") %>% unique() %>% nrow() #Looking at both MovieId and title to confirm that count is the same

#Q4: How many different movies are in the edx dataset?
edx %>% select("userId") %>% unique() %>% nrow()

#Q5: How many movie ratings are in each of the following genres in the edx dataset? (Every time the genre appears)
#Drama, Comedy, Thriller, Romance

#Drama: 
edx %>% select("genres", "rating") %>% filter(str_detect(genres, "Drama")) %>% group_by(genres) %>% nrow()
#Comedy: 
edx %>% select("genres", "rating") %>% filter(str_detect(genres, "Comedy")) %>% group_by(genres) %>% nrow()
#Thriller: 
edx %>% select("genres", "rating") %>% filter(str_detect(genres, "Thriller")) %>% group_by(genres) %>% nrow()
#Romance: 
edx %>% select("genres", "rating") %>% filter(str_detect(genres, "Romance")) %>% group_by(genres) %>% nrow()


#Q6: Which movie has the greatest number of ratings?
edx %>% select("title", "rating") %>% group_by(title) %>% summarize(num_ratings = n()) %>% arrange(-num_ratings)

#Q7: What are the five most given ratings in order from most to least?
num_rate_table<- edx %>% select(rating) %>% table() %>% as.data.frame() %>% arrange(-Freq)

#Q8: True or False: In general, half star ratings are less common than whole star ratings (e.g., there are fewer ratings of 3.5 than there are ratings of 3 or 4, etc.).
num_rate_table %>% mutate(dot = str_detect(., "\\.")) %>% group_by(dot) %>% summarize(Freq = sum(Freq))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
